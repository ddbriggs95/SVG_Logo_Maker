# SVG_Logo_Maker

This challenge asked me to generate a simple logo (utilizing SVG) automatically to be used for projects so you don't have to pay for a graphic designer. User can invoke this application and input the correct information through prompts directly from the command line.

- WHEN I am prompted for a shape
- THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: Square, Circle, or Triangle
- WHEN I am prompted for shapes color
- THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexidecimal number)
- WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
- THEN an SVG file is created named 'logo.svg'
- AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed to the command line
- WHEN I open the 'logo.svg' file in a browser
